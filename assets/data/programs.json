Reactions, interactions and creation – the science and study behind the building blocks of life. Chemical Engineering students learn about organic and inorganic chemistry, statistics and chemical processes and reactions. They use creativity to solve issues related to process, design, to innovate products, research and manufacturing. Chemical Engineers work in a wide variety of roles such as civil service, process engineering, entrepreneurship, management, manufacturing, research and development, or move on to pursue graduate studies.",
